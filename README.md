## I Cosplay as a Java Developer sometimes. 

This repo is proof to my friend group who are all Aerospace Engineers that Java can do a better job that MATLAB

This program calculates the stresses in cylindrical structures (e.g. Pipes or Tanks).

It computes longitudinal (axial) stress, hoop (circumfrential stress), and maximum shear stress.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
